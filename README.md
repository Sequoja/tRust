# tRust

The tRust framework allows observing the execution of parallel Rust applications. This framework provides a modified Rust compiler for the automated insertion of probes into the observed program and its dependencies. A run-time library enables the transmission of observation data to a central collector application for persistent storage. This centrally collected data allows for extensive analysis of the run-time behavior of the program.
